# Sink Implementation Spec

### December 2024 - Francesco Severino, Andrew Heller, Nic Nikcevic

This project will be broken into three components. The user interface of the app. The backend storage of player data. The competition algo

## UI

This component will be written in Swift.

## Backend

This component will be written in Swift.

### Notes

- Supabase, look into
- good documentation
- takes care of lots annoying stuff, like authentification
- 

## Player Algorithm

The algorithm will be based off the chess ELO algorithm.

## Big Questions:

### How the files in the project interact with each other?

### We need to plan the file heirarchy of our project?

- do we have a style sheet?
- is each view/window it's own file?
- Where is the navigational logic kept?
- How will we store data?
- How do we link backend to frontent?
- Where is algorithm logic kept?
